One of the ivy streamers which swung in the wind was caught by a gust and blew aside, revealing something that had been hidden for ten years. It was the round knob of a door. Mary's heart began to thump and her hands to shake a little in her delight and excitement. The robin kept singing and twittering away and tilting his head on one side, as if he were as excited as she was. She put her hand out and turned the knob.

The mythical ashes immediately became associated with the 1882–83 series played in Australia, before which the English captain Ivo Bligh had vowed to 'regain those ashes'.
