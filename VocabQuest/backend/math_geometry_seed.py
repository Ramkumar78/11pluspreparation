        "diff": 7,
        "explanation": "Area = L x W. 48 = L x 4. Length = 12cm. Perimeter = 2(L + W) = 2(12 + 4) = 2(16) = 32cm."

        "diff": 8,
        "explanation": "Case 1: The 40° is the unique angle. Remaining 140° is split by 2 = 70°. Largest is 70°. Case 2: The 40° is one of the base angles. Then the other base is 40°. The third angle is 180 - 40 - 40 = 100°. 100° is larger than 70°."
