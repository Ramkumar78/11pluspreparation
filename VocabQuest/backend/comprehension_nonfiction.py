        "content": """Before the 18th century, most people lived in small villages and worked on the land. They made their own clothes and grew their own food. This way of life changed dramatically with the arrival of the Industrial Revolution. It began in Britain and spread across the world, transforming society from agrarian to urban. New machines, like the steam engine, allowed goods to be produced faster and cheaper in large factories. People flocked from the countryside to growing cities like Manchester and Birmingham to find work. While this brought technological progress, life in the factories was often harsh. Men, women, and even children worked long hours in dangerous conditions for little pay. The sky turned grey with smoke from coal fires, and the quiet rhythm of nature was replaced by the deafening clang of machinery. The world had moved from the speed of a horse to the power of steam.""",

This can happen when a star is dying. Because no light can get out, people can't see black holes. They are invisible. Space telescopes with special tools can help find black holes. The special tools can see how stars that are very close to black holes act differently than other stars. When a massive star runs out of fuel, it collapses under its own weight. If the star is big enough, it vanishes from view, leaving behind a region of darkness that nothing can escape. This boundary is called the event horizon. Anything crossing this line is pulled in forever. It is like a cosmic vacuum cleaner, but one that never gets full.""",
