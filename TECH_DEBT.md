# Technical Debt & Improvements

## Low Priority
- [ ] **E2E Testing:** Implement Playwright/Cypress tests.
- [ ] **Script Testing:** Add unit tests for utility scripts in `backend/scripts/`.
- [ ] **Port Configuration:** Standardize port usage between local dev (5000 vs 5001) and Docker to avoid confusion.
- [ ] **Remove Hardcoded URLs:** Replace `http://localhost:5001` with environment variable or relative path proxy.
